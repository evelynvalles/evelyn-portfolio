                    <p>As a full-stack developer with a tremendous passion of traveling and front-end design, I programmed this travel website to find real-time 
                    hotel availablity at the world's most popular tourist attractions. Additionally, Travel.com is a full-stack Python website that features
                    the option for users to register and login and to book their dream vacation. While designing Travel.com, I took much 
                    care into the front-end design in order to provide users with a modern and attractice booking website and stand out 
                    from others.</p>

                        <p>This project was created in a one-week sprint with another software developer. The inspiration behind this project 
                        came from the idea that we wanted to create a sense of community for people who are trying to break into software 
                        development from non-traditional backgrounds. Therefore, a platform was established where website visitors can share
                        experiences and exchanging ideas via forming/joining study groups, creating/commenting on posts regarding jobs, 
                        interview preparation, lifestyle, and success stories.</p>
